## Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Data structures and algorithms are essential to computer science, which is the study of data, 
its representation in memory, and its transformation from one form to another. In programming, 
we use datastructures to store and organize data, and we use algorithms to manipulate the data
in those structures. The more you understand about datastructures and algorithms, 
the more efficient your Java programs will be.
