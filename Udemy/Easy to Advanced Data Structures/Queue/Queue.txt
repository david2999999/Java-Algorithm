What is a Queue?
    - A queue is a linear data structure which models real world queues by
      having two primary operations
      - Enqueue
      - Dequeue

When and where is a queue used?
    - Any waiting line models a queue, for example a lineup at a movie theatre
    - Can be used to efficiently keep track of the x most recently added elements
    - Web server request management where you want first come first serve
    - Breath first search (BFS) graph traversal

Breath First Traversal
    - Expanding the frontier of one node outwards
        - Visiting the neighbors of our current node first before visiting the neighbor of neighbors
    - Add the starting node to our queue
        - Mark our starting queue as visited
    - While our queue is not empty
        - We will dequeue from our queue
            - Iterate through all the neighbors
                - if the neighbor is not visited yet
                    - Add the neighbor to the queue
                    - Mark the neighbor as visited
    - After the queue is emptied, we have visited every node
