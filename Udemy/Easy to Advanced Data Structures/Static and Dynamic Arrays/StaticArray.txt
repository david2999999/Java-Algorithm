Static Array
    - A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements
      indexable from the range [0, n-1]
    - Question: What is meant by being indexable?
        - This means that each slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number
    - Arrays are contiguous chain of memory, each of the memory addresses are adjacent

    - When and where is static array used?
        - Storing and accessing sequential data
        - Storing objects
        - Used by IO routines as buffer
        - Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
        - returning multiple values from a function
        - dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems
