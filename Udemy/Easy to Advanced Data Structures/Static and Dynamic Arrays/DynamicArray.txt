Dynamic Array
    - The dynamic array can grow and shrink in size
    - How can we implement a dynamic array
        - One way is to use a static array
            - Create a static array with an initial capacity
            - Add elements to the underlying static array keeping track of
              the number of elements
            - If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new
              static array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements into it.
