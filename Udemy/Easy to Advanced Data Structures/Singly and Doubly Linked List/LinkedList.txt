What is a Linked List?
    - A linked list is a sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes
      also containing data.

Where are Linked Lists used?
    - Used in many List, Queue, and Stack implementation
    - Great for creating circular lists
    - Can model real world objects such as trains
    - Used in separate chaining, which is present in certain HashTable implementations to deal
      with hash collision
    - Often used in the implementation of adjacency lists for graphs
