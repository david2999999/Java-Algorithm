Ways of Implementing a Priority Queue
    - Priority Queues are usually implemented with heap since this gives them the best possible
      time complexity
    - PQ is an abstract data type, hence heap are not the only way to implement PQ
        - We can use an unsorted list to implement a PQ, but it will not give us the best time complexity
    - There are many types of heaps we could use to implement a PQ
        - Binary Heap
        - Fibonacci Heap
        - Binomial Heap
        - Pairing Heap

Binary Heap
    - A binary tree that supports the heap invariant.
        - In a binary tree every node has exactly two children
    - A complete binary tree is a tree in which at every level, except possibly the last is completely filled
      and all the nodes are as far left as possible
        - This will be helpful later when we are inserting element into the heap

Binary Heap Representation with array
    - Let i be the parent node index (zero based)
        - Left child index: 2i + 1
        - Right child index: 2i + 2
