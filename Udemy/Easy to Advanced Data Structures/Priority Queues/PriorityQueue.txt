What is Priority Queue?
    - Priority queue is an abstract data type that operate similar to a normal queue.
        - Each of the element has a certain priority
        - The priority of the elements in which the priority queue determine the order in which
          elements are removed from the PQ
    - PQ only supports comparable data, meaning the data inserted into the PQ must be ordered in
      some way either from least to greatest or greatest to least.

What is a Heap?
    - A heap is a tree based DS that satisfies the heap property.
    - If A is a parent node of B then A is ordered with respect to B for all nodes A,B in the heap.
    - There are 2 types of heaps
        - Max heap, where the parent element is greater than its children
        - Min heap, where the children elements are greater than the parent
    - Heap is not the same as priority queue
        - Priority queue is an abstract data type
        - Heap is just an implementation that full fills the PQ properties
