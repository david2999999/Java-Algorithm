What is Priority Queue?
    - Priority queue is an abstract data type that operate similar to a normal queue.
        - Each of the element has a certain priority
        - The priority of the elements in which the priority queue determine the order in which
          elements are removed from the PQ
    - PQ only supports comparable data, meaning the data inserted into the PQ must be ordered in
      some way either from least to greatest or greatest to least.
