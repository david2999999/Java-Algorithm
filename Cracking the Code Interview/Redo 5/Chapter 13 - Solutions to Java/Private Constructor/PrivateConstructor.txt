Question
    Private Constructor: In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

Answer
    - Declaring a constructor private on a class means you can only access to its constructor if you could also access
      A's private methods
        - A's inner classes can access A's private methods
        - If A is an inner class of Q, then Q's other inner classes can also access
    - This has a direct implication for inheritance
        - Only A's inner classes or its parent's inner class can inherit from A
