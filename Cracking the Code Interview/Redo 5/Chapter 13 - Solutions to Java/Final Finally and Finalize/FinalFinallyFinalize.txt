Question
    What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

Final
    - Used to control whether a variable, method or class is "changeable"
        - When applied to a primitive variable, the value of the variable cannot change
        - When applied to a reference variable, there reference variable cannot point to any other object in the heap
        - When applied to a method, the method can not be overridden
        - When applied to a class, the class can not be subclassed

Finally
    - Used in a try/catch block to ensure that a segment of code is always executed
        - Examples can be
            - Closing HTTP URL connections
            - Closing Database connections
            - Clean up work
            - logging
    - 'finally' block will execute even if an exception is thrown
        - but will not execute if the JVM exits from the try block

Finalize
    - The Java's garbage collector calls the finalize() method just before actually destroying the object
    - A class can override the finalize() method from the object class to define custom behavior
        - Clean up
        - Open files
        - release resources
        - etc
