Question
    TreeMap, HashMap, LinkedHashMap: Explain the differences between TreeMap, HashMap, and
    LinkedHashMap. Provide an example of when each one would be best.

What does all of the different maps provide?
    - They all offer a key->value map and a way to iterate through the keys
    - The difference between these classes is the time complexity and the ordering of the keys

HashMap
    - Offers O(1) lookup and insertion
    - Ordering of the keys are arbitrary
    - it is implemented with an array of LinkedList
