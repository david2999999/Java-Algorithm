Question
    Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed with empty strings, write a
    method to find the location of a given string.

Thoughts before Coding
    - We have an sorted array of elements, and we need to find a value
        - This sounds like a question that needs a modified binary search
    - How do we handle cases if our middle elements hits an empty String?
        - We can search to our left/right to find our closest non empty string,
          before performing our binary search
