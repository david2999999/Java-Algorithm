Question
    You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the
    end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

Thoughts before Coding
    - Since, we have enough space at the end of array A, we do not need to allocate extra space
    - If we try to put elements in front of array A, we will be shifting all of the elements over
        - We should try replacing elements from the end
    - Our ordering of our merged array is ascending, so the largest element is at the end
        - We should start comparing our 2 arrays from the end
    - The information we currently need is
        - The last index of array A with elements
        - The last index of array B
        - The index of our merged
