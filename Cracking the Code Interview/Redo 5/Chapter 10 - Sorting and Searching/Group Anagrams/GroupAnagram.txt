Question
    Write a method to sort an array ot strings so that all tne anagrams are next to
    each other.

Thoughts before coding
    - How do we know if 2 strings are anagrams
        - The 2 strings has the same character count
        - The sorted order of the 2 string is the same
    - We can create a custom Anagram comparator
        - By sorting both of the strings
        - Then comparing the values of the sorted strings
        - What is the time complexity of this approach?
            - Time complexity = O(nlogn) + O(nlogn) = O(nlogn)
                - O(nlogn) = sorting first string
                - O(nlogn) = sorting 2nd string
    - We do not actually need to sort the entire array, we just need to be able to group anagrams together
