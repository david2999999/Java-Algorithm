Question
    Peaks and Valleys: In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal
    to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent
    integers. For example, in the array {5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys. Given an
    array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.

    EXAMPLE
        Input: {5, 3, 1, 2, 3}
        Output: {5, 1, 3, 2, 3}

Thoughts before Coding
    - In our previous approach, we have sorted our input array first before arranging it into peaks and valleys.
    - The sorting aspect of the approach cost us O(nlogn) runtime
    - We have to find a way to sort the array by peaks and valley without using sorting.
