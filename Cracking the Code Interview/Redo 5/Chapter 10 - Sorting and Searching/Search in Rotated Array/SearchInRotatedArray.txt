Question
    Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown
    number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was
    originally sorted in increasing order.

Thoughts before Coding
    - This question is very similar to finding to the pivot point in a rotated array
        - In that example, we search through the array by comparing our middle element with our leftmost element
        - this will determine if our pivot point is on the left or the right
    - We can use a similar binary search strategy in this problem
        - In this question, one half of the array must be sorted in ascending order
        - For example
            - If our middle element is greater than our left element
                - that means our left side is in ascending order
            - If our middle element is less than our left element
                - that means our right side is in ascending order
        - Can we use this rule in our problem?
