Question
    Find Duplicates: You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. The
    array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory
    available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?

Thoughts before Coding
    - Since we have 4 kilobytes of memory, we can hold up to 32,000 bits.
    - We can use each individual bit to represent an integer from our array
    - We create create a bit set class of 1000 integers (each consist of 32 bits)

Answer
    - We will first instantiate a bit set with 1000 integers, (each with 32 bits)
        - So we have 32,000 bits and can represent our 32,000 numbers
    - As we iterate through our input array, for each value k
        - We have to first subtract 1 from k, since our bitset is 0 based and our integers starts at 1
        - we can divide the number by 32 to get the integer in our bitset that represents the value
        - After we found our integer in our bitset, we can check the specific bit that represents our number by mod 32
    - If this bit is already set
        - we have found a duplicate value
        - print this number
    - If this bit is not set
        - This is not a duplicate value
        - We will set the bit

Gotchas
    - In order to find the proper bit position,
        - we will need to mod by 0x1F, which is 31
        - We must not forget that we are 0 based index
