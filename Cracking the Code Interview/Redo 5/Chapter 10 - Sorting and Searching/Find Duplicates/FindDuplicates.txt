Question
    Find Duplicates: You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. The
    array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory
    available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?

Thoughts before Coding
    - Since we have 4 kilobytes of memory, we can hold up to 32,000 bits.
    - We can use each individual bit to represent an integer from our array
    - We create create a bit set class of 1000 integers (each consist of 32 bits)

Answer
    - We will first instantiate a bit set with 1000 integers, (each with 32 bits)
        - So we have 32,000 bits and can represent our 32,000 numbers
    - As we iterate through our input array, when we encounter a integer value
        - we can divide the number by 32 to map the value to a integer in our bitset
            - we need to make sure to subtract our number by 1 first,
                - Since our bit array set starts at 0
                - Our numbers in our array starts at 1
        - After we found our integer in our bitset, we can check the specific bit that represents our number by mod 32
        - If this bit is already set
            - we have found a duplicate value
            - print this number
        - If this bit is not set
            - This is not a duplicate value
            - We will set the bit
