Question
    Find Duplicates: You have an array with all the numbers from 1 to N, where N is at most 32,000. The
    array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only 4 kilobytes of memory
    available, how would you print all duplicate elements in the array?

Thoughts before Coding
    - Since we have 4 kilobytes of memory, we can hold up to 32,000 bits.
    - We can use each individual bit to represent an integer from our array
    - We create create a bit set class of 1000 integers (each consist of 32 bits)
