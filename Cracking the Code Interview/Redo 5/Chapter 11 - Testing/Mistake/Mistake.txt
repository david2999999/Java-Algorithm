Question
    Mistake: Find the mistake(s) in the following code:
        unsigned int i;
            for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
            printf("%d\n", i);

Answer
    - We have declared an unsigned integer, which only allow values that are greater than or equal to 0.
    - Our for loop does not determinate, because our 'i' will never hit a negative value
    - Also, we are trying to use '%d' to print out an unsigned integer,
        - We should change the print format to '%u'
    - In order to properly print values from 1 - 100, descending order
        - Our condition must be 'i > 0'
    - In order to properly print values from 0 - 100,
        - We must use 'break' when we have reached number 0
