Question
    Write an algorithm to print all ways of arranging eight queens on an 8x8 chess board
    so that none of them share the same row, column, or diagonal. In this case, "diagonal" means all
    diagonals, not just the two that bisect the board.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - So, in order for a queen placement (row, column) to be valid
        - There must not be another queen at the same (row)
        - There must not be another queen at the same (column)
        - There must not be another queen in the same diagonal
            - How do we check if 2 queens are in the same diagonal?
                - The difference in rows is equal to the difference in columns
                - For example, if our first queen is at (0, 1) and our 2nd queen is at (2, 3)
                    - The difference in row is 2
                    - The difference in column is 2
                    - So we know they are diagonals of each other
    - So, how do we find all of the valid queen placements?
        - We can start with the first row and place a queen at one of the columns
        - Then we can move to the next row and place a queen at one of the columns assuming it is valid
        - We will continue down the columns for only valid queen placements in each of the rows
        - How can we use this method to find a solution?
