Question
    You have a stack of n boxes, with widths w1 , heights h i, and depths di . The boxes
    cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly
    larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth. Implement a method to compute the
    height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - For the problem, imagine that be have boxes b1, b2, b3, we will need to find the maximum height of
        - if b1 is the bottom box
        - if b2 is the bottom box
        - if b3 is the bottom box
    - So, after placing our bottom box, how do we find the maximum height for our boxes above it?
        - Same process
            - if we put b1 at the bottom box, we will need to test
                - if b2 is our 2nd box
                - if b3 is our 2nd box
    - Since, we will only be experimenting with valid boxes, we do not want to try a bigger box on top of a smaller box
        - we can first sort the boxes in descending order
        - So, we know the box later down the list is able to be on top of our current box
