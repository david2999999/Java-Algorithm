// By using a pseudorandom number generator to determine program values, we
//get a different input to our program each time we run it. This feature is, in fact, what
//makes pseudorandom number generators useful for testing code, particularly when
//dealing with arrays. Even so, we should not use random test runs as a replacement
//for reasoning about our code, as we might miss important special cases in test runs.
//Note, for example, that there is a slight chance that the orig and data arrays will be
//equal even after data is sorted, namely, if orig is already ordered. The odds of this
//occurring are less than 1 in 3 million, so itâ€™s unlikely to happen during even a few
//thousand test runs; however, we need to reason that this is possible.
