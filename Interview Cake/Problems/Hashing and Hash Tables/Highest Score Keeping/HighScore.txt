Question
    You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.
    Each round, players receive a score between 0 and 100, which you use to rank them from highest to lowest.
    So far you're using an algorithm that sorts in O(nlgn) time, but players are complaining that
    their rankings aren't updated fast enough. You need a faster sorting algorithm.

    Write a method that takes:
        - an array of unsortedScores
        - the highestPossibleScore in the game
        - and returns a sorted array of scores in less than O(nlgn) time.

Thoughts before coding
    - We are trying to beat O(nlogn) time in sorting
    - We are sorting an array with values that are in the range of 0 to 100.
    - One way to get O(n) time is to use counting, where we can build an array call scoreCount,
      where the index is the number and the value represents how many times the number has appeared
