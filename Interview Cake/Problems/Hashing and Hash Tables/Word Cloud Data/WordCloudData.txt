Question
    You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

Thoughts before Coding
    - We need to find words from a string and keep a counter for each unique word
        - How do we know if we have found a word?
            - We can iterate through the string and check if our current element is a letter (Character.isLetter(c))
            - We can have a starting index of a word and have a counter for the length of the word
            - Then we can use a substring method to create the word
                - Make sure to NOT use concatenation on the word (a new string is created for each concatenation, can cause O(n^2) runtime)
    - Is there any side cases we need to consider?
        - What about for capitalized words?
        - How do we separate words?
            - Is it by space?
            - Is it by punctuation?
            - Are we accounting for the last word in our string?
        - Do we need to account for special unicode characters?
