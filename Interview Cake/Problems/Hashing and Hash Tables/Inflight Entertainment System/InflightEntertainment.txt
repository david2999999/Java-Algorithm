Question
    Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands
    before they can see the ending. So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will equal the exact flight length.

    Write a method that takes an integer flightLength (in minutes) and an array of integers movieLengths (in minutes) and
    returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength.

    When building your method:
        - Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
        - Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
        - Optimize for runtime over memory

Answer
    - What are the different approaches to this problem?
        1) The first solution can just be comparing an element with every other element using 2 nested 'for' loops
            - This checks if 2 elements adds up to the target sum
            - What is the time and space complexity of this solution?
                - Time complexity = O(n^2) - since we are iterating through the array with 2 nested 'for' loops
                - Space complexity = O(1)
            - Can we improve our time complexity by sorting?
        2) If we sort our array, we can find our complement of each element by using binary search.
            - What is the time and space complexity of this method?
                - Time complexity = O(n log n) + O(n log n) = O(n log)
                    - O(n log n) - for sorting the elements
                    - O(n log n) - for each of the elements, we take O(log n) time to find its complement
                - Space complexity = O(1)
            - Can we have a faster runtime if we use a data structure?
        3) We need a data structure that has a very quick lookup time.
            - We can use HashSet with its lookup time of O(1)
            - As we iterate through the array
                - We will check if the difference between are target sum and our current element is inside our HashSet
                    - If it is inside the HashSet, we have found our pair, return true
                    - If it is not inside our HashSet, we will store this element and continue on
                - If we iterate through the whole array, and did not find a pair, we will return false
            - What is the time and space complexity?
                - Time complexity = O(n) - we only iterate through the array once
                - Space complexity = O(n) - we used a HashSet to hold our previous elements
