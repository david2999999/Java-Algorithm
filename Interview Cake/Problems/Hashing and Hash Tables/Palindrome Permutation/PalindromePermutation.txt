Question
    Write an efficient method that checks whether any permutation of an input string is a palindrome.
    You can assume the input string only contains lowercase letters.

Thoughts before coding
    - How can we determine if a string is palindrome?
        - A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forward.
        - This means there are even count for each of the characters
            - There is one exception, where there is a single character at the center of the string
    - Can we use this information to create a solution?
        - We can iterate through the string and keep track of the count
        - After we have finished count, we can check that there is at most one character that has an odd count

Answer
    1) What data structure can be used to keep track of count?
        - We can use a HashMap to hold our character and its count
            - key = character
            - value = count
        - After we finish traversing our array, we can just iterate through our HashMap to make sure that there is at most
          one character that has an odd count.
        - What is the time and space complexity of this approach?
            - Time complexity = O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
                - O(n) - iterate through our string the first time, keeping track of the count of characters
                - O(n) - iterate through our HashMap to make sure there is at most one character that has an odd count
            - Space complexity = O(n) - Our HashMap that is keeping track of the count
