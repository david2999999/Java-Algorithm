Question
    We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in arrays. Write a method to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Can we just merge the two arrays and then sort the whole array
        - What is the time and space complexity for this approach?
        - Time complexity = O(n) + O(nlogn) = O(nlogn)
            - O(n) - to merge the two arrays
            - O(nlogn) - to sort the two arrays
        - Space complexity = O(n) - the space to allocate the merged array
    - Since, in the problem, our arrays are already sorted, maybe we can use this aspect to our disadvantage


Gotchas
    - Where else is this concept of merging 2 sorted array arise?
        - Merge Sort!
