Question
    Write a method reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters and reverses the order of the words in place.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Since, we are reversing the words in place, we will be able to achieve O(1) space complexity
    - Can we do try reverse the string, by swapping words at the front and words at the back?
        - How do we figure out where words start/end?
        - Once, we know the indices of the two words, how do we swap them?
        - What if the words that we are swapping have different lengths?
            - This will result in the whole array being shifted
        - The runtime complexity of this method will be O(n^2), where we have as many words as characters
          and every single swap requires us to shift the whole array (the length of the swap words are different).
        - Can we do better?
