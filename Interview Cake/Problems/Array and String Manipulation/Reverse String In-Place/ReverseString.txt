Question
    Write a method that takes an array of characters and reverses the letters in place.

Thoughts before Coding
    - Why are we reversing an array of characters instead of a string
        - This is because a String is immutable and we need a mutable type to be manipulate in place.

Answer
    - Check the parameters
        - if the array is null or only has one element, return from the function
    - Create two variable
        - one variable will start from the beginning of the array at index 0
        - one variable will start from the end of the array at index array.length - 1
    - While our left index is less than our right index
        - Swap the elements at the two indices
        - increment our left index
        - decrement our right index

    - What is the time/space complexity?
        - time complexity O(n / 2) = O(n), where n is the size of the array
        - space complexity, we only declare two primitive variables for indices, O(1)
