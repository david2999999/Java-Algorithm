Question
    You're working with an intern that keeps coming to you with JavaScript code that won't run because the braces, brackets, and parentheses are off.
    To save you both some time, you decide to write a braces/brackets/parentheses validator.

    Let's say:
        '(', '{', '[' are called "openers."
        ')', '}', ']' are called "closers."

    Write an efficient method that tells us whether or not an input string's openers and closers are properly nested.

Thoughts before Coding
    - We need to think of a data structure to use
        - Lets see what do we need
            - What should we do when we see an opening bracket?
                - We want to save this opening bracket later to be matched with a closing bracket
            - What should we do when we see a closing bracket?
                - We need the last opening bracket to check if it matches with our closing bracket
        - So we need a data structure to
            - Quickly add a opening bracket
            - Quickly remove our most recent opening bracket if a closing bracket is found
        - We can use a Stack!
