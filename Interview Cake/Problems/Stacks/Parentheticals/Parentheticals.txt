Question
    "Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this (and this))) they get confusing."
    Write a method that, given a sentence like the one above, along with the position of an opening parenthesis, finds the corresponding closing parenthesis.
    Example: if the example string above is input with the number 10 (position of the first parenthesis), the output should be 79 (position of the last parenthesis).

Thoughts before Coding
    - When we think of matching parentheticals, we think of stacks
    - But, the only elements inside our stack are going to be 'opening' brackets
    - Instead of our storing our opening brackets, we can just keep a count of the number of opening brackets instead
    - This will help us attain O(1) space

Solution
    - We will have a counter to hold our number of parenthesis
    - We will first starting with the index on our opening parenthesis
        - If we see an opening parens, we will increment our counter
        - If we see an closing parens, we will decrement our counter
            - If our counter reaches zero, we have found our closing parent that we need
            - Return the index
    - What if we do not found a closing paren after looping through the String?
        - Throw an exception or return -1

    - What is the time and space complexity?
        - Time complexity - O(n)
            - We only need to iterate through our String once
        - Space complexity - O(1)
            - Instead of using a stack, we have used a counter instead

Gotchas
    - If our stack is only going to contain 1 kind of element, we should just use a counter instead
