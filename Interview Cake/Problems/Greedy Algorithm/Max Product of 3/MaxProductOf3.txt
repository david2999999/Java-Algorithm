Question
    Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.
    The input arrayOfInts will always have at least three integers.

Thoughts before coding
    - What if we try to brute force the problem by making three iterations of 'for' loop
        - Multiplying each integer by another integer
        - Then using the product to multiply another integer
        - What is the time complexity of this approach?
            - It is O(n^3), we can do better
    - What if we try to sort the array in ascending order and take the 3 largest element from the end of the array?
        - The sorting take O(nlogn) runtime
    - Since, we must check through each of the elements to find the three largest elements, we must use at least O(n) runtime
