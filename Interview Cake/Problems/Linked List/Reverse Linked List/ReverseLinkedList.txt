Question
    Hooray! It's opposite day. Linked lists go the opposite way today.
    Write a method for reversing a linked list. Do it in place.
    Your method will have one input: the head of the list.
    Your method should return the new head of the list.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Lets first find a way of not doing it in place and get back to it later
    - Since, to reverse a linked list, we can push a copy of the node into a stack
        - Then when we pop all of the elements out, our linked list will be reversed
    - What is the time and space complexity?
        - Time complexity = O(n) + O(n)
            - O(n) - Push our elements into the stack
            - O(n) - Pop our elements our of the stack to generate a reversed linked list
        - Space complexity = O(n)
