Question
    Delete a node from a singly-linked list, given only a variable pointing to that node.

Thoughts before Coding
    - Before we delete the node, lets think about how do we delete a node in singly linked list
    - If we have the nodes
        a -> b -> c
    - In order to delete node b, we must have access to node a, the previous node
    - But currently, we only have access to node b and its next element c
    - Instead of deleting node b, can we try to modify it instead?
