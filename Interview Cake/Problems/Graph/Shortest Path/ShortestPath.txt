Question
    Given information about active users on the network, find the shortest route for a message from one user (the sender) to another (the recipient).
    Return an array of users that make up this route.

Thoughts before Coding
    - What data structure can be used to represent a network of users?
        - Graph!
    - Now, we need to find shortest path between two nodes
        - How do we know if there is even a path between 2 nodes?
            - What traversal can we use?
                - Breath first search
                - Depth first search
        - We should use Breath first search to find the shortest path, because it searches for nodes that are neighbors
          to our current node first.
        - If we use a depth first search, we may miss a node by one degree and we will end up searching many other users.
    - After we know there is a path between 2 nodes
        - How will we reconstruct our path?
        - For each of the nodes, we need to know the previous node in order to backtrack our path

Gotcha
    - Queue interface inherits isEmpty method from its super interface.
    - Converting a list to array with the built in method
        - list.toArray(new type[list.size()])
    - Use a HashMap when trying to construct a path
        - Key - Current Node
        - Value - Previous Node
