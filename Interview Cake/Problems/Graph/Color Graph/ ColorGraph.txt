Question
    Given an undirected graph with maximum degree D, find a graph coloring using at most D+1 colors.

Thoughts before Coding
    - Let's first check if there is actually a way for a graph with a maximum degree D to be colored with at most D + 1 colors
        - For each of the nodes, there will be at most D neighbors
        - Since, we have D + 1 colors, there will always be at least one color that is not used
        - So, yes there is a possible coloring
    - What is the brute force way for this?
        - Imagine we have 4 colors and 12 nodes
        - For each of the nodes
            - Try every possible coloring there is
            - If the color is legal, then go to the next node
            - Otherwise check for another color
        - What is the time complexity of this approach?
            - Since there are 4 colors for each node
            - There are (4^12) combinations
            - This results in O(D^N)
        - We also need to factor into the fact that we also need to check its neighbors
          for each of the colors to make sure there is no duplicate color between adjacent nodes
            - If there M edges in each node
            - Then our runtime is O(M * D^N)
